# Fonts Directory

This directory contains font files used in the portfolio project.

## Required Fonts

- Inter_Bold.json - For 3D text rendering with Three.js
- Inter-Regular.ttf - For regular text rendering
- Inter-Bold.ttf - For bold text rendering

## How to Get These Fonts

1. For the JSON font files needed for Three.js:
   - You can generate them using tools like facetype.js (https://gero3.github.io/facetype.js/)
   - Or download pre-converted fonts from Three.js examples

2. For the TTF font files:
   - Download from Google Fonts: https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter
   - Or use any other font of your choice

## Note

If you don't have these fonts, the application will fall back to system fonts, but the 3D text components may not render correctly.
